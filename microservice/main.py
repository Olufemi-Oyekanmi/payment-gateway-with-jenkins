#   Brief overview:                                                                                           #
#     The payment gateway microservice has been implemented initially as an 'extension to' our legacy         #
#     payment processing system.  What this means is that all core data related to transaction, payment       #
#     gateway type definition, and credentials presently lives in the legacy database.  For time to market    #
#     reasons, this microservice has not including a shift of all of the legacy payment processing and        #
#     payment gateways.  What WAS achieved was to structure things in the legacy platform such that no net    #
#     new legacy database tables need to be created any more (previously, each new payment gateway type       #
#     required an additional table in the legacy database), and all new payment gateway logic and payment/    #
#     refund processing take place here in the microservice.                                                  #
#                                                                                                             #
#     Further, within this code itself, each payment processor class is implemented with a consistent set of  #
#     methods, thus enabling the various endpoints handling payment, refund, etc. requests to instantiate     #
#     the appropriate processor (based on the payment gateway type specified in the incoming request) and     #
#     then be blissfully unaware of which processor it is calling - the method names are identical across     #
#     each and every payment gateway class.                                                                   #
#                                                                                                             #
#     As with all of our microservices, logging is routed to a common location outside of the legacy          #
#     database.                                                                                               #
